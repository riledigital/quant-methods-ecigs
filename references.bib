Results: Completers (2,769/3,298) were aged 16.4 years (standard deviation Æ 1.4) with 48.9\% males and 43.9\% African-American, 38\% white, and 4.6\% Hispanics.

	abstract = {Objective
To examine the relationship between tobacco cigarette brand recognition, and e-cigarette use in adolescents.
Design
Cross-sectional observational study.
Setting
High schools in Scotland.
Participants
Questionnaires were administered to pupils in Secondary 2 (S2 mean age: 14.0 years) and Secondary 4 (S4 mean age: 15.9 years) across 4 communities in Scotland. An 86\% response rate with a total sample of 1404 pupils was achieved.
Main outcome measures
Self-reported previous use of e-cigarettes and self-reported intention to try e-cigarettes in the next 6 months.
Results
75\% (1029/1377) of respondents had heard of e-cigarettes (69.5\% S2, 81.1\% S4), and of these, 17.3\% (10.6\% S2, 24.3\% S4 n=1020) had ever tried an e-cigarette. 6.8\% (3.7\% S2, 10.0\% S4 n=1019) reported that they intended to try an e-cigarette in the next 6 months. Recognition of more cigarette brands was associated with greater probability of previous e-cigarette use ({OR} 1.20, 99\% {CI} 1.05 to 1.38) as was having a best friend who smoked ({OR} 3.17, 99\% {CI} 1.42 to 7.09). Intention to try e-cigarettes was related to higher cigarette brand recognition ({OR} 1.41, 99\% {CI} 1.07 to 1.87), hanging around in the street or park more than once a week ({OR} 3.78, 99\% {CI} 1.93 to 7.39) and living in areas of high tobacco retail density ({OR} 1.20, 99\% {CI} 1.08 to 1.34). Never having smoked was a protective factor for both future intention to try, and past e-cigarette use ({OR} 0.07, 99\% {CI} 0.02 to 0.25; and {OR} 0.10, 99\% {CI} 0.07 to 0.16, respectively).
Conclusions
Higher cigarette brand recognition was associated with increased probability of previous use and of intention to use e-cigarettes. The impact of tobacco control measures such as restricting point-of-sale displays on the uptake of e-cigarettes in young people should be evaluated.},

	abstract = {E-cigarettes are devices through which a nicotine solution is ‘vapourised’ and inhaled by the user. Unlike cigarettes, the process involves no tobacco combustion. However, the inhalation and exhalation of vapour is reminiscent of smoking and there is debate about the possible harms and benefits of e-cigarette use, including the ‘renormalisation’ of smoking. Despite these debates, there has been little exploration into the embodied and semiotic similarities between smoking and vaping. This paper views the practices of vaping and smoking through the lens of performativity that is, the accumulation of meaning associated with the habits over time and space. Through in-depth interviews, we explore how young adults from primarily disadvantaged areas in Scotland, understand the similarity in practices between smoking and vaping. Participants talked about financial barriers to using different types of e-cigarettes, and how their use reflected their views on smoking cessation. They also discussed the embodied similarities between smoking and vaping, with divergent opinions on whether this continuance of habit was beneficial or not, revealing still developing and ambiguous norms around performativity. The norms of vaping were also frequently discussed, with participants’ experiences and views reflecting the contested position of vaping in an environment where cigarette smoking is denormalised.},

Few national surveys document the prevalence of e-cigarette use in the U.S. The existing metric to assess current use likely identifies individuals who have recently tried an e-cigarette but do not continue to use the product.
Purpose
To document the prevalence of e-cigarette ever use, current use, and established use in a nationally representative survey of current and former cigarette smokers in the U.S.
Methods
A random sample of current and former cigarette smokers completed a web-based survey in June 2013 (n=2,136). Data were analyzed in November 2013. Multivariate logistic regression identified demographic and smoking-related factors associated with each use category. Point estimates with 95\% {CIs} described e-cigarette use behaviors (e.g., preferred brand, purchasing patterns) for each group.
Results
Almost half of respondents had tried e-cigarettes (46.8\%), but prevalence of established use remained low (3.8\%). Although trial of e-cigarettes was highest among daily smokers, the odds of being an established e-cigarette user were greater for former smokers ({OR}=3.24, 95\% {CI}=1.13, 9.30, p{\textless}0.05). Furthermore, e-cigarette preference and use patterns varied among ever, current, and established users. Established users reported using rechargeable e-cigarettes, having a regular brand, and using e-cigarettes at home and in the workplace at much higher levels than the “current use” metric captures.
Conclusions
Improved survey measures for e-cigarette use are needed. The identification of established e-cigarette users may provide insight to product features or other individual factors that are associated with sustained use of e-cigarettes.},

  abstract = {Background: Neighborhood factors reported subjectively by residents and measured objectively at the census tract are both associated with adolescent alcohol, tobacco (cigarette and electronic cigarette), and other drug (marijuana) ({ATOD}) use. Less clear is how these neighborhood factors are longitudinally associated with each substance. Equivocal ﬁndings may be due to lack of consideration of individual, peer, and family eﬀect modiﬁers, which could help adolescents overcome exposure to stressful neighborhood environments.
    Methods: We used multivariate logistic regressions with interaction terms to test whether parental monitoring, resistance self-eﬃcacy ({RSE}) and being around peers who use {ATOD} modiﬁed the association between four subjective and objective neighborhood measures and odds of using each substance measured one year later among 2539 high school students and college freshmen originally recruited from middle schools in Southern California.
    Results: Census tract-level disadvantage was not longitudinally associated with {ATOD} use. However, perceptions of higher neighborhood disorganization, less social cohesion, and more neighborhood problems with alcohol and drug use were associated with higher odds of {ATOD} use. Higher {RSE} and weaker aﬃliations with peers who use {ATOD} consistently buﬀered negative eﬀects of neighborhood disorganization and neighborhood problems with alcohol and drugs on past year {ATOD} use.
    Conclusions: Community-level programs that increase social cohesion among neighbors, neighborhood monitoring of deviant behaviors, and better policing of open drug selling may prevent {ATOD} use. Programs should also target {RSE} and minimize aﬃliations with peers who use {ATOD}, which could reduce the magnitude of the association with {ATOD}, even for adolescents living in the most at-risk neighborhoods.},
